# Jurassic World Hub

The Jurassic World Hub is a 3D interactive website showcasing the dinosaurs of the Jurassic franchise. If you are a fan of the Jurassic Park/World movies, this is the perfect site for you to visit. When you enter the site, you are brought to a menu with every single dinosaur specimen available for speculation. When in the lab, you have the option to listen to an audio recording about the dinosaur, and an option to view the dinosaur fossil records on an interactive map. I hope you enjoy looking at the beautiful assets of Jurassic World.

# Programming

The programming was done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used a combination of React, Vite, GSAP, and Three JS. React was the JavaScript library I used to create jsx pages that have both HTML and JavaScript code. I used CSS for styling the pages UI, to make it more sci-fi themed to fit with the website. I used Vite for making the website more responsive to screen size and user input, as well as making it easy and simple to deploy the site once it was finished. I used GSAP animations for the UI, making it look more immersive and less simplistic. Finally, and most importantly, I used Three JS, a JavaScript library with 3D rendering capabilities for rending the dinosaurs in the website. This was biggest part of the project, and was what made the whole website truly unique.

# Art and Animation

The models were all downloaded from Sketchfab. Animations were included too, but I had to use Blender to modify some of the animations to fit them with the sounds.

# Sound effects

To make the sound effects for the dinosaurs, I downloaded youtube videos of sounds from the original Jurassic Park/World movies. I then converted them to mp3 files, and used Blender to combine the sounds together and match them with the animations. I used ElevenLabs AI voice to create audio clips for the dinosaurs, and for the intro of the website.
